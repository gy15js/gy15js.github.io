<h4> What the Model Shows </h4>
In brief, the model presents an environment and agents within this. The agents move and eat the environment to gain food/energy for their store. The speed of the agent’s movement within the model depends on the amount of food within the store level. The agents have also been told to share the environment with its neighbours, but, if the agent has low store this eradicates that politeness of sharing!
