<h3 style="font-family:arial;">I: Overview</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> This HTML has been developed as part of assessment one of the programming module. </p>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> All the code and the model presented here, has been developed by Jessica Swain at the University of Leeds </p>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> This website consists of two pages -one for personal information and one for the model and an explanation of what the model does. Please use the list above to use the website. </p>

	
<h4 style="font-family:arial;">II: Personal Information</h4>

<p "font-family:arial;"> Jessica Swain is a Geographical Information Systems MSc student at the University of Leeds. </p>

<p "font-family:arial;"> This code has been developed inline with the Core Skills module for Semester One 2018. </p>
<p "font-family:arial;"> The skills that have been developed within this model have the potential to be used for modelling customers or other interests within retail geography at a later date. </p>


<h5 style="font-family:arial;">III: Model Information & Links </h5>
<h6 "font-family:arial;"> What the Model Shows </h6>
	
<p "font-family:arial;">In brief, the model presents an environment and agents within this. The agents move and eat the environment to gain food/energy for their store. The speed of the agent’s movement within the model depends on the amount of food within the store level. The agents have also been told to share the environment with its neighbours, but, if the agent has low store this eradicates that politeness of sharing!
